"""Flat resolution: Barnes (2014), the QEHT default since v0.13.

Barnes, Lehman & Mulla (2014) resolve a flat with two BFS gradients:
    toward : distance from the flat's low edges (its outlets)
    away   : distance from its high edges (adjacent higher terrain)
combined as   flat_mask = w * toward + (flat_height - away),  w = 2.
Each flat cell flows to the same-flat neighbour with the lowest flat_mask.

v0.13: this reproduces Barnes' own implementation (RichDEM) cell for cell -
low-edge cells leave the flat directly and neighbours are scanned W, NW,
N, NE, E, SE, S, SW (oracle: _reference.reference_barnes_richdem). Flats
touching boundary drains (grid edge / NoData) drain to them.

The weight w is kept for research; the Processing tools use w = 2 (the
v0.12 'hybrid' option was removed after the WP-G benchmark showed it
reproduces Barnes). Properties of w:
  * w = 2        exactly Barnes 2014;
  * w -> inf     the away term only breaks ties: flow follows a shortest
                 path to the outlet (tested), like toward-lower - but among
                 EQUALLY short paths the Barnes rules (same flat, cardinal
                 first) choose differently from toward-lower (first in E,
                 SE, S ... order). On broad real flats that choice dominates:
                 on a 30 m coastal clip every w from 1.5 to 1e6 gave nearly
                 the same network (stream IoU vs toward-lower 0.394-0.399,
                 ~44 % of flat cells routed differently). w is therefore a
                 weak control there; the tie rule is the strong one;
  * 1 < w < 2    stronger push off the high edges.
Why any w > 1 is safe: a cell only ever flows to a neighbour with a
STRICTLY lower flat_mask, so no cycle is possible for any w. Every cell
with toward = t > 1 has a neighbour with toward = t - 1 whose flat_mask is
lower by at least w - 1 > 0 (away changes by at most 1 per step), so only
low-edge cells (toward = 1) can be local minima, and those drain out of the
flat by the exit rule. For w <= 1 interior false sinks become possible.

Size switch (optional speed setting): flats with fewer than
`small_flat_cells` cells use the toward gradient only (the away BFS is
skipped); larger flats use the full gradient. Per flat, so there are no
seams.

Implementation: fully vectorised - edge finding by neighbour shifts,
labelling by union-find with pointer jumping over equal-elevation links,
BFS by whole frontiers over a compact adjacency list - except the exit
rule for low-edge cells, which exits only to cells routed before the pass
(order-independent and cycle-free; v0.8.3's rule could form 2-cell cycles).

Iteration: a pass only resolves flats whose outlet is already routed;
passes repeat until nothing more resolves (flats drain in hierarchy order).
