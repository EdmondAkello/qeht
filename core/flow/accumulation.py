"""Flow accumulation and Strahler ordering by topological traversal.

O(N) after flow direction is established. No recursion - a recursive
downstream walk overflows the stack on any real DEM, and Python's
recursion limit would be hit long before the memory limit.

Algorithm: count how many upstream cells drain into each cell (indegree),
queue every cell with indegree 0 (a ridge/source cell), then repeatedly
pop a cell, push its load downstream, and decrement the receiver's
indegree - enqueueing it once it reaches 0. Each cell is popped exactly
once and its total is complete when popped, so there is no double
counting.

    Parameters
    ----------
    direction : 2-D internal direction index array (from d8_direction).
    valid : 2-D bool array.
    weights : optional 2-D float array of per-cell contribution. Default
        is 1.0 per cell, giving the standard D8 convention where accumulation is
        a count of upstream cells and EXCLUDES the cell itself. Pass a

        for weighted accumulation.
