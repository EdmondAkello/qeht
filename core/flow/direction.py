"""D8 flow direction - steepest descent weighted by distance.

This is the module that most needed writing from scratch. The reference
plugin we studied assigns each cell's receiver during a priority-flood
traversal, which means:

  * diagonal and orthogonal neighbours are weighted identically, and
  * the receiver is the traversal parent, not the steepest descent.

Standard D8 (as used by commercial GIS/hydrology toolsets) selects the neighbour maximising

    drop / distance     where distance = cellsize      (orthogonal)
                                       = cellsize*sqrt(2)  (diagonal)

Getting this wrong biases flow paths toward diagonals and changes both
accumulation values and catchment boundaries. We implement the weighted
form.

Flat handling
-------------
After filling, flats are common and have no steepest descent. We resolve
them with a gradient-toward-lower-terrain BFS: cells adjacent to a flat
outlet get distance 1, their flat neighbours 2, and so on; each flat cell
then routes to the flat neighbour with the smaller BFS distance.

This is the "gradient towards lower terrain" half of Garbrecht & Martz
(1997). We do NOT implement the "gradient away from higher terrain" half
in v0.1. Consequence: drainage across wide flats is plausible and fully
connected, but converges to fewer channels than commercial reference
toolsets typically do. This is a
KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED DIVERGENCE - it must be stated in any validation
report comparing our output against a reference hydrology toolset's result over flat terrain.
Avoid this by using min_slope > 0 during filling, which largely removes
flats before routing.
