"""Depression filling by priority-flood.

Deliberately separated from D8 routing. DDM HydroLogic fuses the two -
its priority-flood pass emits the receiver graph directly, so the flow
direction it produces is the traversal parent rather than the steepest
descent neighbour. That is fine for connectivity tracing but it is not
compatible with standard D8 routing and it ignores diagonal distance entirely.

Here, conditioning produces ONLY a conditioned elevation surface. Routing
is a separate decision made in `qeht.core.flow.direction`. That separation
is what lets a user document which conditioning method was applied - which
is the difference between a defensible drainage design and a black box.

depression-filling and watershed-labeling algorithm for digital elevation
models", Computers & Geosciences 62:117-127. O(n log n).

    """Fill depressions, returning (filled_dem, n_filled_cells, seed_count).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dem : 2-D float array, elevations. Values under ~valid are ignored.
    valid : 2-D bool array, True where the cell carries real elevation.
    min_slope : optional gradient (m per m) imposed across filled flats.
        0.0 gives a classic flat fill (matches common `Fill` tool behaviour). A small
        positive value (1e-4 is typical) tilts filled surfaces so that
        downstream routing has a defined direction instead of relying on
        flat-resolution. Applied as an epsilon increment per traversal
        step scaled by cell size.
    progress : optional callable(fraction_0_to_1, message).

    Returns
    -------
    filled : 2-D float array. Cells outside `valid` are set to NaN.
    n_filled : int, count of cells whose elevation was raised.
    seed_count : int, number of boundary outlet cells seeded.

    Method (v0.12)
    --------------
    Priority-flood (Barnes et al. 2014a) - with or without epsilon -
    produces the unique solution of

        F = z                                   on the boundary seeds
        F = max(z, min over valid neighbours of F + epsilon)   elsewhere

    (the lowest "spill" surface; with epsilon > 0 every filled step rises by
    epsilon). v0.12 computes that solution by frontier relaxation, fully
    vectorised: start from +inf inside, and repeatedly lower the neighbours
    of the cells that changed, until nothing changes. The result is
    identical, bit for bit, to the v0.8.3 heap implementation (kept in
    core/flow/_reference.py as the test oracle) and runs in a small
    fraction of the time.
